### docker-compose.yaml

- worked together to draft up our docker-compose.yaml file
- updated sample_service to playboxx_service
- added environment for the services, will add signing_key in the future
- Set up the database image, volumes, environment, and ports

### migrations

- Set up users, games, and scores tables with everyone
- Should maybe include tables from stretch goals so we don't need to alter tables later on?
